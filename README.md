# calculator

For this project i developed an calculator that can receive inputs by the user through clicks on the interface or the use of keyboard(numpad). The main struggle with this project was to develop a simple logic of a calculator syntax, where the expressions would be evaluated only if it made sense(operator (OPERATION{*/-+}) operator (EQUALS{=}) value to be used as a operator, etc). Some small bugs remain, but most of it are outside the scope of what entails a simple calculator. The final version can be acessed through this link:
